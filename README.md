Todo 2.0 was created as the final project for the javascript course. The app uses TailwindCSS and jQuery for most of the looks and functionality, with a little additional css. It's a recreated version of the project 1 of this course and the idea was to recreate it as closely as possible. 

Features include: a pretty pink UI, option to add, remove and filter items to the list, hover effects on the buttons and javascript events when buttons are clicked

The project was a good experiment for jQuery and overall a pleasent experience. I would give it a 5/5 stars and would do ageen.

You can try the app on netlify :D

Will be published to netlify:https://todo-part2.netlify.app/
